# Codru Web framework

**NOTE: This project is now unmaintained. It has been abandoned in 2016. If you're seeking for a high availability, high concurrenty, fault tolerant system please refer to Elixir and the Phoenix web framework.'.**


Codru or LostMVC (older version) was a Web Framework I've developed between 2013 and 2016.
It was developed using Tcl and made especially for the NaviServer (Aolserver) Web server.
It was a high concurrenty MVC framework with a lot things in it.
